## Summary
Overall, this data set confirms that bike programs are useful and used by customers. It is also shown that males prefer to use this service and that the peak times are weekdays from 5-7PM and most trips last under an hour. Another chart we could pull together would like at the start station and see if there is a certain area of the city is more popular. If there is a location that is more popular we could look to see if there is a similar city plot in Des Moines. It would be interesting to see if a lot of bikes are used for commuting to and from work. Another visualization we could look at BikeIds and how far/frequently they are able to be used.
